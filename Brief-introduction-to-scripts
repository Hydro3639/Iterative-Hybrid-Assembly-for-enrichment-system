Here are some basic commnad you could follow to perform the iterative hybrid assembly/binning method

#### If you have too much long/short reads, please subsampling the dataset, this strategy, on one side, will short the running time, on the other side, lower the complexity of the system to some degree.

## Subsampling datasets using seqkit
